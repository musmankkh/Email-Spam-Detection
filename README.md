## Introduction
Spam emails are a persistent problem in digital communication, causing productivity loss and potential security risks. This project addresses this challenge by developing a robust spam detection model.

---

## Research Gaps and Novelty
### Identified Gaps:
- Lack of focus on evolving spam tactics in existing models.
- Insufficient datasets or limited language diversity in training.

### Novelty:
Our approach integrates advanced NLP techniques with modern machine learning models, focusing on adaptability to new spam patterns. The solution also emphasizes multilingual support and real-time classification.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of our spam detection model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified emails.
- **Precision**: Measure of true positives among predicted spam.
- **Recall**: Measure of spam emails correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

## Comparison with Existing Work
The proposed model is benchmarked against:
- Traditional rule-based methods.
- Popular machine learning classifiers like NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest.
- Deep learning approaches, including recurrent and convolutional neural networks.

Our results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of accuracy and robustness.
